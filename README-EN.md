#### Introduction

🎢 Using Java development tanks war games, at present is still in the state of the original.

🎨 Programs use the multi-threading, IO Java basic technology such as flow, do not need to rely on any library can be run. Later will consider the use of network programming, JDBC or Hibernate (such as after my study

🎯 I want have a heap of added to the game, I want to make it a powerful, rich props, pure and fresh and lovely picture tanks war game (see below for details)

😎 If you are familiar with Java or willing to participate in the demo of the game, game experience or technical advice 👩‍💻👨‍💻, I welcome you to join us! 🧑🎉✨




#### The game interface display

</div>


#### 使用说明

1.  Download the program.
2.  Run ”src\\game\\tankGame\\TankGame01.java“, in the build tool interface type 3 and press enter to generate map file,  then run again, press 1 enter.
3.  If the demo game, now you might be slightly disappointed, because a lot of functions have not joined, so, I'm looking forward to you can finish the work with me.



#### To join this activity

- Download the code and demo game, anything you think needs to be improved in the lssues place.
- Involved in the project development, create your branch and perfect game content. I will you join the "contributor" list.
- Let's do some great things together!



#### About me

The game is I started in 2022 during the National Day, I this period of time are learning Java development language. The design of some places may not be good, if you have the code style, design patterns, etc of Suggestions welcome. I will read it carefully and improve in time. If you are also learning Java, to participate in this project will make you to have a deeper understanding of multi-threading technology, and make you when using multi-threading unexpected things would happen.




#### The next development goals

- For game Settings as shown in the picture above background.
- Design into the main interface after the game, "Settings", "game", "to" the basic options, such as to provide a more complete game inventory operation.
- I'm thinking of game design a convenient and easy to add level interface. 
- Behind the rich add more levels, you can quickly add by low code. So you can avoid mechanical development process, spend more time on more worthwhile.
- Rich design more terrain, aesthetically pleasing levels.
- For the tanks to add "health" this attribute and displayed in the interface.
- Add more lack of props, more kinds of tanks (such as tank can evolve, purchase, the game won gold), more kinds of bullet, more powerful enemies.
- A design more clever enemy tanks. I used some optimization algorithms, similar to genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, etc. I'm thinking through this algorithm make the enemy "smart", so as to provide "difficult mode" for the game, "fled kill model", the end of the "mode", and the big boss of super smart one-to-one challenge, etc.
